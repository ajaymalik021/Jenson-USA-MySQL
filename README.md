## Objectives

### Queries Implemented:
1. **Find the total number of products sold by each store along with the store name.**
2. **Calculate the cumulative sum of quantities sold for each product over time.**
3. **Find the product with the highest total sales (quantity * price) for each category.**
4. **Find the customer who spent the most money on orders.**
5. **Find the highest-priced product for each category name.**
6. **Find the total number of orders placed by each customer per store.**
7. **List the names of staff members who have not made any sales.**
8. **Find the top 3 most sold products in terms of quantity.**
9. **Find the median value of the price list.**
10. **List all products that have never been ordered (using EXISTS).**
11. **List the names of staff members who have made more sales than the average number of sales by all staff members.**
12. **Identify the customers who have ordered all types of products (i.e., from every category).**

## Sample Query

Hereâ€™s an example query to find the total number of products sold by each store along with the store name:

```sql
SELECT store_id, store_name, SUM(quantity) AS total_products_sold
FROM sales
JOIN stores ON sales.store_id = stores.id
GROUP BY store_id, store_name;
